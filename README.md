### What I learned

This simple app help me to solve the little problem that when i writed the answer in a simple file .txt besides the anki screen, i needed a new white space to write the next answer and i lated much scrolling the page or erasing my last answer.

That's because i develop this little app to help me for when a write one answer for anki question when i pass to the next one, i just push cltrl + enter y the answer is erased.

Now is very ease to me advance in my study.

### Continued development

I will continue very soon developing other kinds of apps, more complex and bigger every time, who help me to increase my experiance and capacity in this incredible tec world.
